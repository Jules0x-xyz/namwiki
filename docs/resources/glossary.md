**Shielded**
Private transactions where amounts, senders, and recipients are hidden.

**Transparent**
Public transactions where all details are visible on the blockchain.

**zk-SNARK**
Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge. Cryptographic proof system for privacy.

## Transactions

**Shielding**
Moving assets from transparent to shielded state within MASP.

**Unshielding**
Moving assets from shielded pool back to transparent state.

**Gas**
Computational cost unit for executing transactions.

**IBC**
Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol for cross-chain transfers.

## Staking & Validation

**Validator**
Node operator who proposes and validates blocks.

**Delegation**
Assigning staking power to a validator without transferring tokens.

**Epoch**
Time period for staking rewards distribution.

**Slashing**

**Mainnet**
Production blockchain with real value transactions.

**Testnet**
Test network for development without real assets.

**BFT**
Byzantine Fault Tolerance allowing operation despite node failures.
