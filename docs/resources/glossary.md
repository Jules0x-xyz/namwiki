## C

### CometBFT

### Cosmos
The ecosystem of interconnected blockchains that Namada is part of.

### Genesis
The first block of a blockchain, containing initial configuration and token distribution.

### Governance
The system for making collective decisions about protocol changes and fund allocation.

## H

### Hardware Wallet
A physical device that stores private keys offline for enhanced security.

## I

### IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication)
A protocol enabling communication and token transfers between Cosmos chains.

### Inflation

## K

### Keplr
A popular Cosmos wallet that can interact with Namada.

## L

## M

### Mainnet
The live, production blockchain (as opposed to testnet).

### MASP (Multi-Asset Shielded Pool)

### Mnemonic
See [Seed Phrase](#seed-phrase).

## N

### NAM
The native token of Namada, used for staking, governance, and fees.

### Node
A computer running the Namada software that participates in the network.

### Nullifier

## P

### Payment Address
A shielded address used to receive private transactions.

### PGF (Public Goods Funding)

## Q

### Quorum

### RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
An endpoint for interacting with a blockchain node.

## S

### SDK (Software Development Kit)
Tools for building applications on Namada.

### Seed Phrase

### Shield
To move assets from transparent to shielded state for privacy.

### Shielded
Private state where transaction details are hidden using cryptography.

### Slashing
