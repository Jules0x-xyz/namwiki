# What is Namada?

**Namada** is a proof-of-stake Layer 1 blockchain focused on **multi-asset privacy**. It's designed to bring privacy to any blockchain asset through its unique Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP) technology.

## Key Features

### 🛡️ Multi-Asset Shielded Pool (MASP)

Unlike traditional privacy solutions that only work with a single asset, Namada's MASP allows you to shield **any asset** from any connected blockchain. This means you can:

- Shield ETH, ATOM, OSMO, and other IBC-connected assets
- Make private transactions with any supported token
- Enjoy the same level of privacy regardless of the asset

### 🔗 IBC Compatible

Namada is built on the Cosmos SDK and is fully **IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication) compatible**. This means:

- Seamless transfers between Namada and other Cosmos chains
- Access to the entire Cosmos ecosystem
- No bridges required - native IBC security

### 💰 Shielded Rewards

Namada incentivizes privacy through **shielded rewards**:

- Earn rewards just by holding assets in the shielded pool
- The longer you shield, the more you earn
- Rewards are distributed in NAM tokens

### 🏛️ Decentralized Governance

Namada features a robust governance system with:

- **Public Goods Funding (PGF)**: Community-controlled treasury for funding public goods
- **On-chain voting**: Validators and delegators can vote on proposals
- **Steward system**: Elected community members who manage PGF
